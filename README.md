Artificial life studies the fundamental processes of living systems in artificial
environments in order to gain a deeper understanding of the complex
information processing that define such systems. These topics are broad, but
often include evolutionary dynamics, emergent properties of collective systems,
biomimicry, as well as related issues about the philosophy of the nature of life
and the use of lifelike properties in artistic works. The objective of this project is
to study evolution process in a computer-simulated artificial world. We hope
that, like in the real world, despite randomness and aimlessness of basic
evolution mechanisms, it will lead to creation of more and more efficient
artificial organisms, still better and better adapted to the artificial world
conditions.
